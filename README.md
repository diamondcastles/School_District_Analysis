# School_District_Analysis

## Understanding of Initial Analysis

We broke down the data and analyzed based on two relationships: grades (scores) and budget; grades (scores) and school type. The grades and budget analysis indicates that, generally speaking, the higher the budget, the better the school grades . When looking at the comparison between school types and grades, we see that generally speaking, Charter Schools have slightly higher grades than public schools.

## Additional Analysis

We could also analyze whether or not the amount of students in the school has an impact on average grades or not as well. This is due to the fact that despite the higher budgets that Public Schools have, Charter Schools have better overall grades (scores), but they have far less total students than Public Schools
